# ElmLisp
> An experimental LISP syntax for Elm language, and an ElmLisp â†’ Elm transpiler. 

----

What this enables us is one simple thing: **macros** and thus, less boilerplate!

A small example:

```racket
(module Main)

(type-alias Model Int)

(type Msg
  Inc
  (DecBy Int))

(def init : Model
  0)

(defn decBy : (-> Int Model Model)
  (amount model)
  (- model amount))
```

becomes... (or, at least, it should when I'm done implementing it :sweat_smile:)

```elm
module Main exposing (..)

type alias Model =
    Int

type Msg
    = Inc
    | DecBy Int

init : Model
init =
    0

decBy : Int -> Model -> Model
decBy amount model =
    model - amount
```

So far, this is just a different syntax for Elm, and in itself is not worth writing in (at least I wouldn't!). **Being a LISP, though,** we can use macros to get rid of some boilerplate! Let's see:

**TODO:** example of macro usage!

### Usage:

You can read input code from STDIN:
```
$ elmlisp
```

Or from a file:
```
$ elmlisp input.ell
```

### Download:

- [v0.0.3 (Linux 64bit)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Janiczek/elmlisp/0.0.3/dist/elmlisp)

### Compiling from source (also requires Racket!):

This will create an `elmlisp` binary in the src/ folder:

```
$ raco exe src/elmlisp.rkt
```

Alternatively, you can run the compiler with Racket interpreter instead of a binary, simply substitute `elmlisp` for `racket src/elmlisp.rkt` (this requires Racket).

### Structure of this repo

```
- src/
    - elmlisp.rkt - Application entrypoint. Run/compile this file.
    - format.rkt - Helper functions for how to emit Elm source code.
    - parse.rkt - Module concerned with how to read string with ElmLisp source code into s-expressions.
    - compile.rkt - The meat of the application. Compiles s-expressions into Elm source code strings.
    - helpers.rkt - Various helpers and predicates for the compiler.

- tests/ - Diff tests - input files and expected output files. Look here for examples of ElmLisp!

- run_tests.sh - Test runner watcher (runs test_runner.rkt when src/ or tests/ changes).
- test_runner.rkt - Script for running the test suite once.
 
```

### TODO

- [ ] some commandline friendliness, dude
- [ ] examples of macros
- [ ] Elm records, tuples, lists: [here's how **#lang clojure** does it](https://github.com/takikawa/racket-clojure/blob/master/clojure/reader.rkt#L28-L36)

- [ ] `(defn)` (both with and without type annotations)
- [ ] `(effect-module)` - read up on it, see what has to be specified. I suspect there is a potential macro lurking somewhere!
- [ ] `(type-alias)` with records
- [ ] `(case)` (tests) both with and without wildcard, and destructuring
- [ ] `(let)` (with destructuring too)

- [ ] comments
- [ ] destructuring in fn arguments
- [ ] destructuring in fn arguments - what about ADTs with one constructor?

- [ ] all the `(module)` definitions rendered at the top (it's technically an error, but the Elm compiler will tell you that)
- [ ] all the `(import)` definitions rendered at the top, sorted

- [ ] refactoring of `compile.rkt` into helper funtions in `format.rkt` (all the `(format "..." ...)` calls)
- [ ] maybe use `elm-format` on the result? cmd-line option for that?

- [ ] binary ops from base
- [ ] macro for specifying stuff as binary ops (ElmLisp can't know about library's operators)
- [ ] operators that are both binary and unary (`-`)

- [ ] how will #t and #f vs True and False play out in macros etc.?
- [ ] maybe try creating a `(where)` alternative to `(let)` as an macro, if that even makes sense in ElmLisp

### Acknowledgements:

- [L++](https://bitbucket.org/ktg/l) by Kim Taegyoon - ElmLisp project is mostly a derivate of L++, repurposed to emit Elm instead of C++! Thank you!
- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) - ElmLisp project is implemented using Racket, and uses Racket's macro system for its own macro syntax. So, thank you! :)
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) - Obviously, Elm is what we compile to. Thank you Evan for such a beautiful language!

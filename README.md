# ElmLisp
An experimental LISP syntax for Elm language, and an ElmLisp â†’ Elm transpiler. 

----

> But why???

Because of one simple thing: **macros!** -- and thus, less boilerplate!

----

ElmLisp looks like this:

```racket
(module Main)

(type-alias Model Int)

(defn inc : (-> Model Model)
  [model]
  (+ model 1))
```

Which becomes...

```elm
module Main exposing (..)

type alias Model =
    Int

inc : Model -> Model
inc model =
    model + 1
```

So far, this is just a different syntax for Elm, and in itself is probably not worth writing in. **Being a LISP, though,** we can use macros to get rid of some boilerplate! Let's see, a hypothetical macro could turn:

```racket
(msg-and-update
  (Inc         Inc            (+ model 1))
  ((DecBy Int) (DecBy amount) (- model amount))
  (Reset       Reset          0))
```

into:

```elm
type Msg
    = Inc
    | DecBy Int
    | Reset

update msg model =
    case msg of
        Inc ->
            model + 1

        DecBy amount ->
            model - amount

        Reset ->
            0
```

**TODO:** think of a more believable macro ;) and finish this section.

### Download [here!](https://github.com/Janiczek/elmlisp/releases)

### Usage:

- Read input code from STDIN: `$ elmlisp`
- Or from a file: `$ elmlisp input.ell`
- Format the result with [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format): `$ elmlisp -f`
- Output to a file: `$ elmlisp -o Output.elm`
- Display help: `$ elmlisp -h`

If you have [Racket installed](https://download.racket-lang.org/):

- You can run ElmLisp interpreted: `$ racket src/elmlisp.rkt`
- Or compile it from source: `$ raco exe src/elmlisp.rkt`

### Structure of this repo

```
- src/
    - elmlisp.rkt - Application entrypoint. Run/compile this file.
    - format.rkt - Helper functions for how to emit Elm source code.
    - parse.rkt - Module concerned with how to read string with ElmLisp source code into s-expressions.
    - compile.rkt - The meat of the application. Compiles s-expressions into Elm source code strings.
    - helpers.rkt - Various helpers and predicates for the compiler.

- examples/ - Examples just for you :) Largely complete Elm modules showcasing ElmLisp.
- tests/ - Diff tests - input files and expected output files. Look here for examples of ElmLisp!

- run_tests.sh - Test runner watcher (runs test_runner.rkt when src/ or tests/ changes).
- test_runner.rkt - Script for running the test suite once.
```

### TODO

#### Minimum Viable Product

- examples of macros
- comments (either make `;` stay in the Elm code as `--`, or have `(-- ...)` or something)
- destructuring (in fn arguments, let and other places, ADTs with one constructor, etc.)
- extensible records!

#### Nice to have
- somehow break up long lines (eg. any substantial `view` function)
- all the `(module)` definitions rendered at the top (it's technically an error, but we let the Elm compiler tell you that)
- all the `(import)` definitions rendered at the top, sorted (even if some macro called it in the middle of the file)
- record updating of inner record fields (`(set-in user.address street "Main St.")` => `let` and all that boilerplate stuff) -- waits for `(let)`

#### Meh
- `(effect-module)` - read up on it, see what has to be specified. I suspect there is a potential macro lurking somewhere!
- refactoring of `compile.rkt` into helper funtions in `format.rkt` (all the `(format "..." ...)` calls)

#### Research
- import of other ElmLisp files? (just of their macros?)
- how will `#t` and `#f` vs `True` and `False` play out in macros etc.?
- maybe try creating a `(where)` alternative to `(let)` as an macro, if that even makes sense in ElmLisp

### Acknowledgements:

- [L++](https://bitbucket.org/ktg/l) by Kim Taegyoon - ElmLisp project is mostly a derivate of L++, repurposed to emit Elm instead of C++! Thank you!
- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) - ElmLisp project is implemented using Racket, and uses Racket's macro system for its own macro syntax. So, thank you! :)
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) - Obviously, Elm is what we compile to. Thank you Evan for such a beautiful language!

# ElmLisp
> A LISP syntax for Elm language, and an ElmLisp â†’ Elm transpiler. 

----

What this enables us is one simple thing: **macros** and thus, less boilerplate!

A small example:

```racket
(module Main)

(type-alias Model Int)

(type Msg
  Inc
  (DecBy Int))

(def init : Model
  0)

(defn decBy : (-> Int Model Model)
  (amount model)
  (- model amount))
```

becomes... (or, at least, it should when I'm done implementing it :sweat_smile:)

```elm
module Main exposing (..)

type alias Model =
    Int

type Msg
    = Inc
    | DecBy Int

init : Model
init =
    0

decBy : Int -> Model -> Model
decBy amount model =
    model - amount
```

So far, this is just a different syntax for Elm, and in itself is not worth writing in (at least I wouldn't!). **Being a LISP, though,** we can use macros to get rid of some boilerplate! Let's see:

**TODO:** example of macro usage!

### Running interpreted (requires Racket):

```
$ racket elmlang.rkt
```

Right now doesn't support input from STDIN or from file of your own choosing - and reads the file `elm-examples/all-syntax.ell` instead. Bug me about this and I will fix this!

----

### Compiling from source (also requires Racket!):

```
$ raco exe elmlang.rkt
```

Will create an `elmlang` binary in your current directory.

### Structure of this repo

```
- elm-examples/
    - all-syntax.ell - All possible (implemented and planned) syntax for ElmLisp, this is my
                       input file when developing...
 
- elmlisp.rkt - Application entrypoint. Run/compile this file.
- format.rkt - Helper functions for how to emit Elm source code.
- parse.rkt - Module concerned with how to read string with ElmLisp source code into s-expressions.
              (How to read commas? How to read [] {} #[]? Etc.)
- compile.rkt - The meat of the application. Recursively compiles various s-expressions
                into Elm source code strings.
```

----

### TODO

- [ ] tests (`lambda.in` -> `lambda.out`, diff with compiler output) for various language constructs
- [ ] refactoring of `compile.rkt` into helper funtions in `format.rkt` (all the `(format "..." ...)` calls)

### Acknowledgements:

- [L++](https://bitbucket.org/ktg/l) by Kim Taegyoon - ElmLisp project is mostly a derivate of L++, repurposed to emit Elm instead of C++! Thank you!
- [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) - ElmLisp project is implemented using Racket, and uses Racket's macro system for its own macro syntax. So, thank you! :)
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) - Obviously, Elm is what we compile to. Thank you Evan for such a beautiful language!
